# SQL Challenge
## Introduction
This project involves designing tables in PostgreSQL to store employee data from the 1980s to the 1990s provided in CSV format. The primary objective is to answer specific questions about the data using SQL queries.
## Data Modeling
I started by drafting an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to visually represent the relationships between tables. For a detailed view, refer to ERD Image.
## Data Engineering
1.	Database Creation: Established the "EmployeeSQL" database to house the relevant tables.
2.	Table Creation Using QuickDBD:
-•	Ensured correctness of column names, data types, and appropriate assignment of primary and foreign keys.
-•	Maintained dependencies between tables.
3.	CSV Data Import:
-•	Imported CSV files into respective tables in the following order:
-•	Departments
-•	Titles
-•	Employees
-•	Dept_manager
-•	Dept_emp
-•	Salaries
## Data Analysis Queries
Utilised SQL queries to answer key questions about the employee data. Refer to [DataAnalysis_queries.sql] for the complete set of queries.
